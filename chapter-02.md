# Role of the Warfare Officer

## Chapter Two - Role of the Warfare Officer

> “Things appear romantic enough in prospect and retrospect, that at the time are only monotony, and sweat, and thirst, and sickening fear.” [1]

### Introduction

The Navy offers an opportunity to perform a duty and to perform it so well that the cause of the country benefits thereby.  The Navy is unrivalled as an interesting life. It is as ever changing as the sea itself. It is exciting. It is absorbing and it is intellectually demanding. 

First and foremost, the Navy is a fighting service. Its mission is to be able to “fight and win at sea”. The successful achievement of this mission requires a corps of officers that are masters of the complex art of naval warfighting.

Expertise in naval warfare comprises a set of unique and wide-ranging skills. Fundamental mariner and warfare skills are initially acquired by following a comprehensive training program, enhanced and sustained
by frequent practice, experience and ongoing individual professional study. Subsequent professional career paths will be different and generally unique to the individual. Decision points will recur during every career, sometimes unanticipated and at short notice. Career decisions present opportunities and challenges. They may exhibit risk. Decisions made in response to these events will affect not only the nature of a career but also, in all probability, the individual’s private life.

### Warfare Officers

For the purposes of this book all Seaman PQ Officers are considered Warfare Officers, as are officers qualified as Pilots or Observers. The Navy requires approximately 1000 trained Seaman Officers to fill about 900 positions in the ranks from Sub Lieutenant to Commander. In addition, 260 Pilots and Observers are required for approximately 220 positions. This is about 60% of all trained navy officer positions.[2]

As an Officer of the Watch, as a specialist warfare practitioner or as a Part of Ship officer, the Warfare Officer is intimately involved in the conduct and direction of the ship’s maritime operations in a leadership capacity. The ultimate goal of the Seaman Officer is command at sea and, to a large degree, the training continuum of Seaman PQ Officers is directed towards this objective. This will see the junior warfare officer progress through his/her training gaining mariner, warfare and specialist qualifications as he/she develops the skills and experience to be a senior warfare officer.

a contract management virtuoso and built a reputation for eliminating fraud in contract supplies. He was appointed as Secretary to the Admiralty in 1672.

> During his career he promoted many reforms including a shipbuilding program of unprecedented dimensions and the introduction of half pay for officers, which made possible the establishment of a core of professional naval officers. This provided the basis for an expansion of the RN that enabled British imperialist expansion in the 18th and 19th centuries and national economic development. He created the administrative foundations that lead to the 20th Century Royal Navy and, through it, the origins of the RAN. He also established a large archive at Magdalen College, Oxford, which became a major library for naval history.

The Navy’s Seaman Officers inherit a professional role that may be traced directly back to Samuel Pepys’ re-organisation of the RN in the 17th Century, through the Australian Navy’s British antecedents. Their role more generally derives from the earliest days of organised naval shipping. Today’s Seaman Officers are therefore the contemporary custodians of precious history and traditions.

Similarly, Pilots and Observers are the custodians of the proud history and traditions of Australian naval aviation, which began in WWI when the RAN operated sea-planes from cruisers attached to the RN and includes the fixed wing carrier era from 1948 to 1982 (see Chapter 9).

### The Role of the Warfare Officer (Seaman PQ)

Seaman PQ Warfare Officers have similar mariner functions to professional Merchant Navy officers to the extent that they are skilled in the art of operating ships safely in the presence of navigation hazards, other ships and unwelcome weather. That said, warfare officers are fundamentally different from their Merchant Navy colleagues by virtue of their skill in maneuvering and fighting ships co-operatively, in close company, at high speed and in a multi-dimensional environment. This skill, exemplified by the award of the Bridge Warfare Certificate for the Seaman PQ, is the distinguishing feature. The later acquisition of ‘specialist’ warfare skills, now expected of all Warfare Officers, equips the officer with the expertise to discharge the specific fighting functions and weapon/sensor use that enable and direct maritime combat operations.

The Seaman Officer’s career has three general phases: mariner, specialist warfare officer, and sea command. These occur sequentially, each phase building upon the skill and experience of the former. The junior warfare officer’s initial career phase is directed towards the award of the Bridge Warfare Certificate and the consolidation of this qualification in a seagoing Officer of the Watch (OOW) appointment. The OOW discharges a very high level of direct personal responsibility compared to other naval, military and community occupations.

After Bridge Warfare Certificate consolidation, the Seaman Officer undertakes training aimed at obtaining specialist warfighting skills and leadership development. These skills are: Principal Warfare Officer, Mine Clearance and Diving, Maritime Geospatial (Hydrography) and Submarines. These are discussed in more detail in a later chapter.

### Bridge Skills
The environment of a ship’s Bridge, where the OOW’s responsibilities are discharged, is invariably complex and energetic.  Many factors affecting the OOW’s performance are external or outside the officer’s control.

Competence as an OOW is a necessary pre-requisite for later specialisation, which builds upon the ship knowledge, navigation, seamanship and ship handling skills acquired when qualifying as an OOW. Equally important are the self- confidence, sense of responsibility and decision making attributes that are intrinsic characteristics in an able OOW.

The achievement of the Bridge Warfare Certificate (BWC) qualification occurs necessarily early in a Seaman Officer’s career and at a young age for the level of responsibility held. This qualification is the Seaman Officers’ bedrock skill, and the level of accountability expected becomes a major influence on personal as well as career development.

### The Role of the Warfare Officer (Pilot and Observer PQ)

Pilots and Observers follow a different career path (see ABR 6289 Chapter 8), which delivers a critical warfighting capability to maritime forces in particular and the ADF more generally. These career paths offer Squadron Command opportunities for selected officers. Pilots and Observers may dual qualify as Seaman PQ officers.The role of Pilots and Observers is discussed more fully in Chapter 9 – Naval Aviation.

### Salt Horse

The ‘salt horse’ is a seaman officer with no recognised ‘specialist’ training beyond that of Bridge Warfare Certificate. The notion of the ‘old sea dog’ with “one hand for the ship and for himself” may retain some romantic attraction but the realities of crewing modern warships demand a multi-skilled and versatile officer. The ‘salt horse’ is not a recognised specialist field and Seaman Officers will be required to nominate their preferred specialisation when they qualify for the Bridge Warfare Certificate.

### Warfare Officer Duties and Responsibilities

The span of occupational employment and skill-based tasks of Seaman PQ Officers, Pilots and Observers is extensive. Specific responsibilities are published from time to time in Defence Instructions (Navy) Administration 30 series. The list at Appendix 2 encapsulates the range of activity in which warfare officers are the professional practitioners.

###￼Sub-Specialisation

The Warfare Officer specialist structure is in the following table.3

After skills and experience are developed as a specialist warfare officer afloat, the Seaman Officer migrates into the Sea Charge Program and through it, the opportunity for Sea Command. From this group most of Navy’s senior leadership team is grown.

### Future Role of Warfare Officers

The Navy will grow into a force with greater flexibility, firepower, lethality and survivability. It will continue to evolve to better contribute to Joint and Combined operations, particularly in the littoral areas that characterise Australia’s area of maritime interest. It will retain the flexibility to perform constabulary operations, aid to the civil community, search and rescue and diplomatic functions.

Technological advances will continue to be pursued where appropriate. Some of the anticipated future capability will be highly automated. Stealthy and efficient hull forms will be introduced with more efficient forms of propulsion.  Future surface ships will have multi- role functionality including air warfare and, potentially, land attack. Large amphibious platforms will also feature in Navy’s future force structure.

Capability upgrades would be achieved more frequently than now with continuous through-life capability improvements and fewer large mid- life upgrades made possible with more open architecture based systems. This would be reflected in the professional development of officers with continued opportunity being provided to update skills consistent with system changes afloat.

There will be emphasis on the shared use of information by co-operating forces and systems. Faster and better decisions will be required, especially as other nation’s maritime capabilities improve. The need to have a faster decision making cycle than an enemy will be reflected in revolutionary information systems. The means to acquire, integrate and distribute information, and then act on it, will continue to evolve and attract investment during the careers of the readers of this book.

Shore infrastructure support is expected to consolidate over time into fewer, larger operational bases with the consolidated capability to support Force Element Groups (FEGs) where possible. By doing so, greater geographic stability for Navy’s people would be achieved.

Against this background there will remain a requirement for proximate numbers of officers qualified to lead and direct the activities of the ship and its aircraft, plan operations and oversee the military and combat tasks. Some variations will occur in specialist skill requirements and other functional qualifications as the threat, systems design and tactics change over time. Officers will be required who possess a deep knowledge of the underlying functionality of ships’ warfighting systems and in particular, the management and presentation of integrated information. Seamanship and navigation skills will remain fundamental in the skill set, supported by improved automation and positioning guidance.

The Warfare Officer cohort will remain the core group from which the Navy selects its Commanding Officers afloat.
