# Chapter Three - Principal Warfare Officer (PWO)

> “Sydney’s gunnery narrative is of great interest both technically and from the more general point of view. It shows the results obtainable by an efficient control team backed by good material, and it should be given the weight due to the experience of a ship which has had the unique opportunity of firing 2200 main armament rounds in action in six weeks.” [1]

## Part 1 – The PWO Function

The PWO on watch is the officer in charge of the Operations Room, to whom authority is delegated by the Commanding Officer to “direct, co-ordinate and control ship operations.” [2] PWOs also undertake designated departmental management roles. PWO is one of four recognised seaman officer specialisations, the training for which takes place in the Principal Warfare Officer Faculty in HMAS Watson.

The PWO is intimately involved in controlling the ship’s activities aimed at accomplishing the assigned mission. To fight and win is a non-negotiable goal because failure to succeed will, in the worst case, involve loss of the ship. The PWO’s pivotal function in fighting the ship assigns great responsibility to the position. It therefore requires the highest standards of professional excellence, leadership and accountability.

PWO training is delivered in two components. The first will be to prepare officers as the PWO of a ‘private ship’ and will qualify the officer as a specialist PWO. The second component will focus on Task Group command level skills and duties, force management concepts, and sub-specialist skills. Officers who complete second level training will be awarded one of four Additional Qualifications (ADQUAL).
The background to the PWO and the four ADQUALs are discussed below.

### Derivation of the PWO Specialisation

After WW II, the RAN had several warfare streams within its Seaman Officers’ cohort, which conformed to those of the RN. These reflected the technology and tactics in use at the time and were influenced by naval operations in WW II. They were: Communications (which included electronic warfare and shore based intelligence collection by radio), Gunnery, Torpedo & Anti Submarine Warfare, Navigation and Direction. Australian naval officers undertook courses in these subjects in the UK, some of which were
12 months in duration.

> Missile Strike on HMAS Hobart 1968. On the morning of 17 June Hobart was patrolling between Tiger Is and the North Vietnamese coast about 25 nm north of the border with the South. Enemy helicopter activity had been reported in the area and a USN ‘Swift’ boat had been sunk. Hobart was tasked by CTU 77.1.0 (CO USS BOSTON) to search for water borne logistic craft and slow moving aircraft.
>
> At 0313 Hobart was struck in the starboard boat space by an air-launched missile. The
ship had been tracking an unknown aircraft at the time. The missile strike was the first indication the ship was under attack. Hobart went to Action Stations, ordered full ahead and manoeuvred violently. The missile hit rendered the SPS 52 radar and the Tartar missile control system unserviceable. Both 5” guns could fire in local control only. The ship was now ineffective as an AAW platform.
>
> The aircraft was now being tracked on the surface search radar (SPS 10) and was observed re-attacking at high speed and low altitude. Two more missiles hit about 90 seconds after the first. The ship had not reached the Action State but the action alarm had the effect of clearing the aft seaman’s messdeck, which proved a fortuitous circumstance. The second missile penetrated the transom at 2 deck level, passed through the Gunners Store, up the passageway, demolished the Engineers Workshop and entered the aft seaman’s messdeck. It set fire to a storeroom, broke a water-main and cut a degaussing cable. A sailor returning from Action Stations four hours later found the bulk of the missile engine casing in his bunk.
>
> The third missile struck starboard side amidships and caused further damage to the fire control systems, gyroscopes and more physical destruction. The loss of gyros made it impossible to direct Boston’s CAP, which had been placed under Hobart’s control.
>
> The attacking aircraft was now observed from the AA Control position. It climbed and turned to re-engage. The forward gun opened fire in local control and the aircraft broke off the attack.
>
> Hobart closed USS Boston, under escort from USS Edson and Chandler. Two sailors had been killed in the attack and 13 injured, three of whom were evacuated by helicopter to Da Nang. Hobart later set course for Subic Bay in the Philippine Is for repairs, which took six weeks.
>
> Later analysis of damage to the Ikara magazine and evidence given during the Investigation revealed that a fourth missile was fired and presumably detonated on the sea surface. The missiles were AIM Sparrow IIIs with an expanding rod warhead fired from an F4 Phantom fighter aircraft, attached to the US 7th Airforce. The cause was described as an “operational error”.

The development of missile warfare during the 1950s and 1960s caused a rethink of the warfare professional structure. Anti-ship missiles greatly reduced the reaction time available to surface ships and represented an ‘all weather’ threat. Warning time did not allow ships the luxury of going to ‘action stations’, which was past practice and which allowed the relevant specialist officers to be turned to. Improved integration of defensive tactics was also required, compared to the highly compartmented tactics then employed. Multi-skilling of officers became necessary. This was originally done by loading up the existing, already long, courses.

The sinking of the Israeli destroyer Elath in October 1967 by Styx missiles fired from Port Said emphasised the changing dynamics of surface ship defence. In the RAN, the missile attack on HMAS Hobart on 17 June, 1968, during operations off the Vietnam coast also demonstrated the changed nature of the threat.

The Royal Navy developed a concept of pre-programmed responses to missile attack initiated by the Operations Room Officer on watch. Following extensive simulator demonstrations and controlled ship trials, the concept was first fully exercised in Exercise Bersatu Parduh3 involving the British Far East Fleet in 1970. The Royal Australian Navy contributed a carrier task group to this exercise.4

From 1972 all Warfare Officers were trained in common tactical procedures such that regardless of the time of day, each ship would have an officer on watch capable of responding to a threat. The days of “Stand to – the dawn!” were over. The early PWO courses were conducted in HMS Dryad in southern England and took seven months. These courses provided the Australian Navy’s initial PWO skills base.

So that deep specialist skills were retained, an Advanced Warfare Course (AWO) was introduced and delivered after an officer had obtained sea experience as a private ship PWO. AWO courses took five months and were available in the traditional warfare streams.

[3] Exercise Bersatu Parduh was the last major exercise undertaken by the Far East Fleet prior to its progressive withdrawal to UK home waters.

[4] This important exercise was also used to further trial the experimental tactic of sector screening as an alternative to fixed, ‘bent line’ screens that were until then the conventional close anti-submarine deployment system.

They were also conducted in the UK. They placed emphasis on Task Group planning, Force Warfare control functions and departmental duties. The PWO/AWO structure was in place for eight years before the two courses were in effect combined into one course.

The cost of UK training increased dramatically in the late 1970s and its relevance was diminishing. From the mid 1960s, the Australian Navy’s fleet composition had altered from a strong British design bias to one of progressively American and home grown origin. The introduction of the American designed and built DDG Class, A4 and Tracker aircraft and the Naval Combat Data System diminished the relevance of RN courses, as did the deployment of indigenous weapons and sensors such as Ikara and Mulloka. The first American designed FFG built for the RAN was launched in 1978.

PWO training was repatriated from the UK and an Australian ‘Surface Warfare Officers Course’ commenced in January 1985. The name reverted back to PWO Course in 1989.

PWO training is conducted at HMAS Watson in the Captain Darling building. Captain Stanley Darling, OBE, DSC and two bars, VRD, RANR served with great distinction in World War II as a specialist in the then emerging field of ASW. PWOs maintain a keen awareness of the RAN’s warfare heritage, and keep alive the memory of pioneers such as Captain Darling through the Naval Warfare Officer’s Association. This organisation includes former and currently serving warfare officers who meet to discuss matters ranging from historical interest to future naval developments. All PWOs are encouraged to become members of the Naval Warfare Officer’s Association.

### PWO Training

PWO training was subjected to another periodic review in 2003 in recognition of the changing and expanding nature of maritime warfare and the limited capacity of the then existing course structure to meet the throughput requirements. Training is delivered in two components. The first component, the PWO Course, qualifies officers to perform the duties of an on-watch PWO in a private ship.

The PWO Course follows a modular structure that includes a core warfare module available to all Seaman PQ Officers, Pilots and Observers, not just PWOs. This provides a common baseline across all warfare disciplines. The PWO Course is about 21 weeks long and includes substantial simulator time and a sea assessment prior to qualification. These are structured to grow self- confidence by adding complexity consistent with the state of progress of the student.

Following experience afloat as a PWO, officers will be able to undertake sub- specialist and Force Warfare training to prepare them to perform Group

Warfare Officer tasks in the Air Warfare, Communications, Navigation and Surface Warfare disciplines. This training will be conducted as an ADQUAL and attract an appropriate suffix to an officer’s post- nominals. Readers are encouraged to consult with the PWO Faculty in HMAS Watson regarding the development and timing of these courses.

### Appointments for PWOs

Thirty PWO trained officers are needed to graduate each year to meet workforce requirements and the PWO course can cater for 36 students per annum. The Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN) also places officers on these courses. 

PWO appointments exist in all major fleet units with the majority being in the Surface Combatant Force Element Group. Ships will carry a mix of PWO and PWO ADQUAL officers.

Sea time ratios conform to Navy standards. There is a wide diversity of shore appointments for PWO’s, which may narrow following the achievement of an ADQUAL.

### Some Aspects of PWO Service

PWO Course standards are high as befits the critical function of the PWO, including the conduct of weapon practices and weapon exchange in real world operations. The level of expertise that is demanded requires an ability to absorb information from multiple sources, prioritise responses and act intuitively. The ability to discriminate between competing options of an urgent nature is expected. Vacillation is not a virtue for a PWO. Intimate familiarity with
the Operations Room and its sailors is axiomatic.

> An intimate knowledge of the Operations Room and how to use it is a fundamental core skill for PWOs. HMAS Melbourne 1992.

> Teamwork in the Operations Room is essential to mission accomplishment.

Safety during training and weapon practices is a major task and considerable emphasis is placed on safety and risk management procedures both during training and operations. In the end, however, the warship’s role is to fight and win and Commanding Officers will expect cogent and honest advice and options from their PWOs, and resolution in combat.

The Operations Room environment is intimate, being both crowded and also the hub of combat decision making and planning. This is a workplace where a sense of humour is a decided benefit. Sea service can be demanding and stressful due to the responsibility borne, the sustained watchkeeping requirements and the limited operational respite during real world operations. Planning and departmental tasks add to the workload. The relationship between the PWO and the Officer of the Watch (OOW) is critical to successful war fighting and ship safety, and is not amenable to misunderstanding. Both the PWO and the OOW are responsible directly to the Commanding Officer for aspects of their duties. Neither officer can function without the support of the other. Co-operative action to achieve shared goals is required. The relative responsibilities of the OOW and the PWO are documented in the DI(N) ADMIN 30 series.[5] The Chief of Navy’s Command Guide [6] is also helpful.

Canberra, 2003.

When the teamwork between the PWO and OOW breaks down, the results can be catastrophic as was the case with the SAS President Kruger:

> **PWO-OOW Case Study:** SAS President Kruger In February 1982 the South African Ship President Kruger, a modified Type 12 frigate, collided with the replenishment ship Tafelberg and was sunk with the loss of 16 lives.
>
> At the time of the collision the two ships, together with the President Pretorious, were conducting an ASW exercise at night. President Kruger was OTC and OCS. The frigates were sector screening ahead of Tafelberg and a reorientation of the mean line of advance was ordered at 0340, from 010 to the south east. The Captain had not been called.
>
> In President Kruger, the Operations Room was controlling and the bridge had the con. The PWO ordered a course change to 180 at which time Tafelberg bore 180 and 3000 yards from President Kruger. The OOW informed the PWO of this fact. The latter’s recorded reply is: “that can’t be – come right another 20 degrees”. The OOW did not question this order and applied 10 degrees of starboard wheel. During the slow turn it was evident from the bridge that President Kruger would cross Tafelberg’s bows. The PWO was not informed.
>
> With the range between the two ships 900 yards, an increasingly anxious OOW called down the voice pipe: “we are closing fast, suggest we come hard left”. The PWO, who had lost Tafelberg in the radar’s ground clutter, ordered “Negative come hard right 240 degrees”. The OOW then said “I’m coming hard left – Port 30”. The second OOW at the pelorus did not hear the OOW but did hear the PWO and ordered “Starboard 30” and President Kruger continued across Tafelberg’s bows. The OOW on the starboard bring wing was unaware that his order Port 30 order was not obeyed. The ships collided.
>
> A number of factors were involved but clearly the relationship between the Bridge and Operations Room was a major contributing factor. The PWO was senior to the OOW, who did not possess a full BWC. The PWO was also the OOW’s Training Officer and did not trust his OOW’s judgement. The OOW did not fully appreciate his responsibility to question the PWO on any decision he felt might jeopardise the safety of the ship.

Continuation training and exercising is a feature of the PWO’s duties and this can be tedious but is essential to maintaining the level of Command Team and Operations Room teamwork and practice upon which proficiency in combat is based. Dash, elan and initiative will be less than valuable attributes, unless they are underpinned by a solid foundation of professional knowledge and task skill.

### Additional Qualifications

Within the PWO specialisation, there are four ADQUALS: Above Water Warfare, Communications, Navigation and Surface Warfare. These are discussed later in this chapter.

## Part 2 - Above Water Warfare

> “Hit first, hit hard, and keep on hitting.”  
> -- Admiral Jacky Fisher

### Role

The Above Water Warfare (AWW) ADQUAL was originally created by combining the duties of the pre-existing Gunnery specialisation and some of those of the Direction Officer specialist.

AWW training has been delivered in a variety of formats over the last thirty years and has remained focussed on the threat from anti-ship missiles and from aircraft. AWW is organised around the integrated employment of guns, missiles, electronic warfare and airborne defence systems.

### Derivations – the Gunnery Officer

It used to be said of Gunnery Officers, that you became one so as to avoid having to serve with one. This was a little unfair – maritime warfare evolved around gunnery and reached its apotheosis with the design and construction of battleships capable of delivering 18 inch shells over 40 kilometres. [7]

The traditional gunnery functions included specialised skills relating to ammunition design and storage, ballistics calculations, aiming and laying of the guns visually and, in due course, by radar. Constant training and drill was required to develop the teamwork necessary between the many components of manually operated, complex gunnery systems. Collateral duties related to Landing and Boarding Parties, ceremonial, small arms and explosive ordnance (when no MCDO was borne).

> “The Gunnery Lieutenant is to have charge of and be responsible for all guns, gun mountings, and machinery in connection with them, including firing gear and night sights, except when the machinery referred to is steam, oil, or gas engine.” [8]

The development of ship-launched missiles was a natural extension of the Gunnery Officer’s duties, although the (relatively) complex and advanced technology of missiles required a shared responsibility with the WEEO.

[7] The Japanese battleship YAMATO, when completed in 1941, had a full load displacement of 72,800 tons and mounted 9 x 18 inch guns, 12 x 6.1 inch and 12 x 5 inch AA guns.

[8] Kings Regulations & Admiralty Instructions, 1913 Chap XXIV para 900

The Gunnery Officer was responsible for the tactics and efficient use of the weapons and the WEEO for the material readiness of the system and the missiles themselves.

The acquisition of the DDG Class in the mid 1960s with surface launched AAW missiles and more automated control and guidance, lead to a re-arrangement of duties for the use and maintenance of AAW systems. Furthermore, automated ammunition handling arrangements diminished the numbers of semi-skilled sailors required to manually transfer ammunition and to maintain electro- mechanical equipment. This was exemplified in the later FFG and ANZAC Class gun systems.

### Derivations – the Direction Officer

Radar was first deployed at sea in 1938 and rapidly improved when better power amplifiers were designed together with smaller, lighter radar antennae. The roles of the Direction Officer had their origins in the use of radar to track aircraft and to direct friendly aircraft movements to engage enemy aircraft formations. This work was pioneered by the Royal Observer Corps in the UK. The radar plotters tracked the position of aircraft on glass boards and the officers directed the movements of friendly ‘planes. These skills were developed and refined by the Royal Air Force, and were operationally demonstrated during the early years of WW II.

> HMAS Hobart conducting naval gunfire support, Vietnam, 1967.

The primary role of the Direction Officer afloat was the control and direction of fighter aircraft, advice on tactics and their co-ordination with other AAW systems. Non-commissioned personnel were also trained in the control and direction of aircraft.

This function was originally focussed on aircraft carrier operations but broadened when specialised air direction ships were developed and, later, AAW platforms. The close connection between the use of radar and the integration of air direction tasks lead to greater involvement of the Direction Officer in the management of the entire action information organisation. Computerised combat data systems automated this process and the Direction Officer was duly assigned responsibility for its efficient use.

### PWO (A) Training

Changing threats, {==systems==} and tactics has required regular redesign of above water warfare training. Future AAW training will be delivered as part of the Force Warfare Officer (FWO) Course and be oriented towards warfare commander functions. The training will be conducted in HMAS Watson as an additional qualification for PWO specialists who have completed at least one posting as a private ship PWO.

### Future AWW Developments

AWW will remain a core function for PWO qualified officers for the foreseeable future. The threat to maritime forces from air launched and airborne weapons will remain. New sensors, weapons
and tactics will require more informed and integrated co-ordination, which
will be underpinned by network centric operations systems.

The introduction of the ADF’s air early warning and control (AEW&C) capability provides an additional layer
of surveillance and direction in the maritime environment. The replacement of the F/A18 by the new aerospace combat capability and the acquisition of air warfare destroyers will provide an improved and contemporary capability for AAW in maritime operations in the period 2010-2020, especially in the littoral. Concepts for both these platforms are being developed in co-operation with Allies.

Pending the introduction of these platforms, current systems will continue to be developed, including missile and gun modifications, improved electronic warfare and close in self-protection systems. Continued requirement for collateral functions such as boarding expertise may be anticipated.

## Part 3 – Surface Warfare 

### Role

The Surface Warfare (SW) PWO ADQUAL was originally created by combining the duties of the pre-existing Anti-Submarine Warfare specialisation and some of those of the Communications Officer specialist.

SW training has been delivered in various formats over the past thirty years and has been focussed on the threat from submarine launched weapons and the management requirements of the Communications Department afloat. SW is organised around the integrated employment of all ASW weapons systems embarked in the force, including maritime airborne platforms. It also includes responsibility for planning and managing the tactical and long-range communications needed to support operations afloat.

### ASW Background

The potency of submarine warfare was demonstrated by its effectiveness in trade interdiction in WW I. Submarines generally attacked while on the surface or with the hull trimmed down. Their underwater endurance was short and their operational diving depth was shallow. Anti-submarine warfare tactics therefore originally involved using traditional surface weapons and close screening of the main body by destroyers.

> Mortar MK 10 exploding ahead of an RAN Type 15 anti-submarine frigate.

After WW I major navies invested in ASW sensors and tactics, which were considered necessary but were (initially) given a low a priority. In the RN, specialist training in ASW was introduced in 1922 at HMS Osprey at Portland to provide suitably trained personnel to staff the evolving ASW structure and systems. Secret research provided the intellectual basis for the design and development of ASDIC 9 (later named sonar) equipment.

Improved weapons became available, originally as under-water bombs (depth charges). Short-range ballistic weapons followed (Hedgehog, for example) which had the pleasing advantage of engaging the submarine without having to pass over the top of it first. The effective range of ship-launched weapons was related to the short range of the sonar systems then available. As sonar performance improved, so too did longer range ASW mortars and, in due course, torpedoes.

System limitations required considerable skill in the conduct of close ASW action, the tactics for which became highly codified. The ‘Reverse Beetroot With Sidestep’ was, for example, a complex tactic for searching for a submarine that was submerged underneath the convoy. Despite developing considerable skill in such manoeuvres, the improved performance of submarines after WW II rendered close ASW action an unwise and unproductive adventure.

The availability of aircraft to spot and bomb submarines changed ASW tactics in WW II by providing defence in depth, which was supplemented by specialist surface ship Task Groups. Subsequent tactical development focussed on airborne platforms, strategic barriers and longer range weapons. Close ASW engagements, although practised diligently, became an in-extremis response, especially when guided torpedoes and submarine launched missiles were fielded.

Training in Torpedo Anti-Submarine (TAS) warfare in the RAN covered torpedoes, mine warfare, sonar, demolition, ASW weapons and related skills. Training took place in HMAS Rushcutter during WW II but relocated to HMAS Watson in 1956.

The RAN maintained a very professional ASW capability, which after 1955 was focussed on the aircraft carrier HMAS Melbourne and six River Class Destroyer Escorts (DE). Melbourne originally embarked Fairey Gannet aircraft and later Grumman Trackers, Wessex 31B and Seaking aircraft, all equipped with ASW equipment of contemporary capability.

￼￼

The Cold War threat to Australia’s sea lines of communication from submarines was such that considerable investment was made in ASW weapons and sensors. The Australian designed Ikara was the first guided ASW weapon to be deployed by navies. The Mulloka sonar was intended as an innovative sonar for Australian requirements and to develop a national industrial capacity.

### PWO (SW) Training

Changing threats, systems and tactics has required regular redesign of surface warfare training. In future, it will be delivered as part of the FWO course and be oriented towards Warfare Commander functions. The training will be conducted in HMAS Watson as an ADQUAL for PWO specialists who have completed at least one posting as a private ship PWO.

## Part 4 – Communications and Information Systems

> “If the said Lord and his fleet encounter enemy fleets where they must fight, they shall show all the ensigns and banners they have, so that each one may do his duty.” [10]

### The CIS Role

Communications and Information Systems (CIS) officers and sailors perform radio system management, visual signals and IT tasks and management duties afloat and ashore. The CIS discipline has been subject to repeated review since 1984 due to the rapidly changing nature of the systems that support maritime communications and the evolving philosophy that underpins them, including the emergence of Network Centric Warfare concepts. Processes and skills of long standing have become obsolete and entirely new and exciting skill requirements have emerged.

The CIS field is expected to remain highly dynamic and at the forefront of contemporary technology because of the essential military need, reflected in current Defence doctrine to improve the availability, integration and distribution of information in support of all forms of warfare.

This will be manifest in the Navy’s transition from a network enabled platform to a network centric force structure, outlined in the Navy’s C4 Master Plan.11

Communications are fundamental to the exercise of command and control. CIS officers and sailors manage its delivery and distribution. Maritime communications are conducted in the context of the Defence Information Environment and the pathways over which it operates. The CIS systems deployed in the defence environment require considerable management to achieve the desired capability and interoperability.

### The CIS Officer

The CIS Officer is an operationally experienced officer with extensive education and warfare training. The CIS Officer’s primary role is the design, implementation and management of the CIS and EW architectures required to support the mission.

[10] 16th Century British naval instructions cited by CAPT Jack Broome in ‘Make Another Signal’, Military Book Society, 1973, p11.

[11] ‘C4-21 - C4 for the 21st Century: The Navy C4 Master Plan’, DNC4ISREW, September 2002.

The CIS Officer will provide advice to the Command on the best use of the information paths available and their onboard management and ensure security through effective information discipline. Critical to the CIS Officer’s task is the ability to manage the competing priorities for limited bandwidth to satisfy operational, logistic, administrative and personnel requirements.

These duties are also exercised at the Force or Task Group level and in managing shore based communications assets, and policy and capability development roles. The duties of the CIS Officer are enumerated in the DI(N) ADMIN 30 series.

### History of the Sub- Specialisation

Communicating between ships at sea and with the shore has been an endeavour since the first days of organised shipping. The ‘Black Book of the Admiralty’ appeared in 1338, which contained two single flag signals. This example aside, until the late 18th century signal books were written and promulgated privately by individual senior officers. In 1799 the Board of the Admiralty printed its first signal book, based on principles developed by Admiral Lord Howe, which had the benefit of being universal. In 1867 the morse code, already in use on landlines, became available to the British Navy when Captain (later Admiral) Colombo invented the flashing signal lantern. This allowed night time communications between units under way for the first time.

> The Battle of Salamis 480 BC. Following the defeat of the Spartans at Thermopylae and the fall of Athens to Xerxes, a small combined fleet from the Greek states organised by Thermistocles confronted Xerxes’ Persian fleet in the narrow straits off Salamis Is, near the present day port of Piraeus. The Greeks were outnumbered about two to one by the Persian fleet of 650 triremes.
>
> Xerxes combined force was split to control each end of the sound, which denied the Persians the ability to achieve concentration of force. The Greeks defeated first the enemy forces to the east and then reinforced their ships to the west.
>
> The turning point in the battle is reputed to have been an unprecedented and highly co- ordinated manoeuvre (a ‘turn together’ in today’s naval language) that gave the Greek ships both the weather advantage and the element of surprise at the western end of the sound. This turn was initiated, so it is said, by a red cloak lashed to an oar and waved vigorously from a prominent position.
> 
> The battle of Salamis was the climax of Xerxes attempt to extend the Persian Empire to the mainland city states of Greece. The devastation and loss of supplies was such that Xerxes withdrew and European civilisation, such as it then was, was saved. (By way of an aside, this event was an interesting use of sea power in defending the exposed flank of a land force, in this case the remnants of the armies of the Greek states)
> 
> Whether this was the first example of such tactical control by signalling we may never know but it is certainly a powerful early example.

> Naval Receiving Station Coonawarra looking north east, October 1940.

In 1898 the British Admiralty issued ‘The Handbook of Homing Pigeons for Naval Purposes’. In the same year radio employing morse code (known as ‘wireless telegraphy’) was first introduced to British naval forces and was used exclusively at the time for long haul communications. This lead to the growth of a corps of user-maintainer radio operators who were occupationally quite distinct from their flag deck shipmates, although both were engaged in naval communications tasks. Until the late 1930s, the Fleet tended to look on wireless as a capricious device that would never displace visual signalling. The Captain kept the Yeoman of Signals at his elbow and may have needed to ask who, precisely, was the Petty Officer Telegraphist?

By 1939 HF and VHF radios were being used and UHF was imminent, inexorably migrating into higher bandwidths as the communications demand grew in response to the faster and more complex warfighting methods. Voice communications emerged, known as ‘wireless telephony’. Inter-ship radio use multiplied dramatically. An organisational nexus was formed between information exchange by visual signalling and that by radio, being fuelled by the encroachment that radio was making on functions previously the domain of the flag deck.

The Communications sub-specialist officer as now known, was created in the RAN in 1948 following RN practice, as a Seaman Officer and part of the weapons/sensor operator organisation. At the same time the RAN created an electrical engineering branch, which progressively assumed all technical support functions. Information systems management was added to the Communications Officer’s duties afloat in 1997.

### Intelligence Collection by Radio Means

Coincident with the introduction of radio communications was its mirror image: radio intercept, which was in place in the RN early in WW I. The development of both radio communications and electronic intelligence collection progressed hand in hand through the 20th Century. Intelligence collection by radio drove requirements for improved cryptography, which become a differentiated skill and, in due course, an automated one when the volume of traffic overwhelmed manual coding techniques. A cyclic process of information protection and penetration ensued and remains a perpetual feature of communications tasks.

Radio direction finding techniques, initially using MF and HF transmissions, were developed which were applied to both navigation and tactical intelligence collection functions afloat. The intercept of radio communications adapted naturally to the intercept of other electronic emissions when radar was introduced, creating the function of ‘electronic warfare’. Specialised receivers and transmitters (jammers) emerged.

The related technologies lead to electronic warfare operations being embedded within the Communications Officer’s responsibilities afloat and ashore. Later technology drivers caused increased specialisation within all three disciplines (communications, tactical EW and intelligence) leading to contemporary organisational structures.

### Postings

CIS appointments are geographically diverse and show a distinctly Joint emphasis. This is reflected in both the range of tasks and the authorities within which they may be undertaken.

In addition to sea duties and those in base communications centres, CIS appointments are available in Maritime Headquarters, Naval Headquarters, the Defence Chief Information Officer’s Office, ADF Warfare Centre, Defence Material Organisation, North West Cape, Joint Force Headquarters, Headquarters Australian Theatre, HMAS Stirling, HMAS Cerberus, Defence Signals School Simpson Barracks and Capability Development.
### Communications Development

The evolving Defence Information Environment will provide the architecture of networks, the Joint infrastructure, web-based infrastructure, and network security for the conduct of Network Centric Warfare. This is emerging as the Navy’s cornerstone warfighting concept and which derives maximum force warfighting potential through rapid and robust networking of diverse, well informed and geographically dispersed warfighters.

The command and control environment of the future must be capable of contending with the complexity of the battle space. Network Centric Warfare will be based on a robustly networked system of sensors, decision aids, weapons, warriors and supporting systems to support Joint and naval forces in their execution of missions across the entire range of military operations. Management of this environment will be a major operational task for the foreseeable future.

### PWO (C) Training

Changing threats, systems and tactics has required regular redesign of sub-specialist communications training. In future, it will be delivered as part of the FWO Course and be oriented towards Warfare Commander functions. The training will be conducted in HMAS Watson and HMAS Cerberus as an additional qualification for PWO specialists who have completed at least one posting as a private ship PWO.

## Part 5 – Navigation

### Role of the Navigating Officer

Navigation is another PWO ADQUAL. The Navigator, assisted by the Navigator’s Yeoman where borne, plays a pivotal role in the Command Team irrespective of the size and type of ship. A ship
can not “fight and win in the maritime environment” if it can not safely navigate to and within the battle space.

The standard of training received by RAN Navigators is very high and compares favourably to that of other Western navies. It provides a logical progression through intermediate, long and advanced training that links prior experience to future employment. Training received at the Australian Maritime College in Launceston during the Advanced Navigation Course provides a valuable broader perspective to the application of navigation principles, especially in larger ships.

Navigating HMA Ships is one of the most challenging and rewarding careers upon which an officer can embark. The responsibility, command relationships, skill and status attached to the Navigating Officer’s role attract considerable job satisfaction and respect.

The Navigating Officer’s function and many of the skills employed can be traced back to the earliest days of organised marine activity. After all, someone had to get all those Greek ships to Salamis in 480 BC to fight Xerxes’ fleet! Polynesian navigators were sailing by the stars in the 12th Century12 and possibly earlier. The voyages of Torres, de Gama, Magellan, Cook, Marion, La Perouse, Beechey and others were as much achievements of navigation as they were ones of seamanship or scientific discovery.

> **The Navigating Officer.** “In my day you could always tell the Navigating Officer by his tie, which was extra shiny and expansively knotted, and by the two inches of white shirt cuff upon which he traditionally scribbled down his fixes. But most of all, you could tell the Navigating Officer by that general air of faintly superior knowledge which, like the bactrian camel, who alone knows the hundredth name of God, sets the Navigating Officer apart from the rest of us.”  
> -- John Winton We Joined The Navy

[12] See for example: Lewis, David. ‘The Voyaging Stars – Secrets of the Pacific Island Navigators’, Fontana Collins 1980.

Even where supported by modern￼￼equipment such as satellite navigation, the Navigating Officer retains the residual skills of the past as a contingency capability. Navigation skills are shared with the merchant marine and recreational users and transfer across the boundary that marks Navy unique warrior skills. Navigation is the core skill of taking ships where we want them to go, safely, and is embedded in the role of a seaman.

There is a view sometimes expressed, that navigation is being automated to the point where the sub-specialist requirement might be questioned. This is not the case. Despite Satellite based Global Positioning Systems (GPS), astro-nav calculators, electronic charts and other forms of modern technology, someone still needs to manage these systems and apply their underlying functionality. More importantly, battle damage, accidents and breakdowns will deprive users of their electronic tools from time to time, and require recourse to contingency ones of a manual nature.

### Training

Intermediate Navigation Course (n) is 14 weeks duration and prepares officers for navigating duties in a minor war vessel. It includes Navigation Yeoman (Nav Yeo) duties because some minor war vessels carry no Nav Yeo. This course and the sea experience that follows as a minor war vessel navigator are prerequisites for the Long Navigation Course.

The Long Navigation Course (N) is 10 weeks in duration. It includes more detailed meteorology, astronomical navigation, tides, ship handling, chart maintenance, navigation equipment operation and capabilities, ship operational planning, passage planning as a senior officer’s navigator, pilotage, Rule of the Road, two weeks in the simulator and two weeks practical sea time which includes a Go/No Go assessment.

The Advanced Navigation Course (N+) is conducted annually and takes approximately four weeks. The course includes deep draft ship handling theory and simulator time. Bridge simulator work with the future Commanding Officer occurs where possible, and includes CTG operations officer assignments.

> Combat in Pilotage Waters. On 10th April 1940, Captain Warburton-Lee in command of the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla entered Ofotfiord under orders to prevent enemy forces landing at Narvik and to interdict supply ships. He was also given discretion to capture the town with a Landing Party! He intended to attack at dawn, at high water, with five destroyers. The enemy force comprised 10 large fleet destroyers and 2,000 troops ashore.
> 
> Captain Warburton-Lee’s force proceeded “through continuous snowstorms, in very low visibility and along strange channels beset with navigational hazards” to arrive off Narvik at 0400. This was done darkened, without radar and while maintaining radio silence. Three destroyers entered Narvik harbour at 0430 and at high speed attacked with guns and torpedoes.
>
> Enemy destroyers now emerged from smaller fiords on the flanks of the British squadron. Captain Warburton-Lee attempted to withdraw under fire from a force which was superior
in both numbers and weapon calibre. A running battle ensued in the gloomy waters of the sound, shrouded in snow drifts and the smoke of gunfire. Both sides lost two destroyers but the British force managed to recover the damaged ship Hotspur – an achievement of both seamanship and navigational excellence.
>
> On 13th April 1940, the battleship HMS Warspite and nine destroyers re-entered the confined waters of the fiords. Lacking tactical surprise the force proceeded at high speed in poor weather and without radar. The remaining German destroyer and supply ships were destroyed.

### Contemporary Change

Increased levels of automation is a feature of navigation that will continue as new classes of ships are brought into service. The rate of change in navigation processes has accelerated since the introduction of radio based aids (initially M/HF Direction Finding, Loran, Decca and Omega) and more recently GPS. [13] Hand held calculators to assist with astronomical navigation and ring laser gyroscopes are other examples of modern navigation aids. Other contemporary developments include the Maritime Transport Security Act 2004, Automatic Identification System (AIS) and the Digital Voice Recording System (DVRS).

The Electronic Chart Distribution Information System (ECDIS) [14] and its related Navigation Display System will have a marked influence on Navigating Officer workloads, especially pilotage planning.

[13] First trialled in the RAN in HMAS Hobart in 1976 during Operation Phineas Fogg.
[14] ECDIS was first installed in the Navigation School HMAS Watson in mid 2004.

This does not of course relieve the Navigator of his skill responsibilities or the need to comprehend the system's functionality and foundation principles. Overseas operational experience indicates that ECDIS will assist Bridge team workload, ship safety and Command confidence.

These and other factors are changing the way the Navigator goes about his business but not what that business is. Despite technological developments, the possibility of collisions, grounding and berthing incidents are still a reality [15], and the requirement for a specialist navigator possessing deep-seated knowledge and understanding of the principles behind the technology will continue.

### PWO (N) Training

Changing systems and tactics has required regular redesign of sub-specialist navigation training. In future, it will be delivered as either part of the FWO Course, or prior to the PWO Course upon completion of service as the navigator in a MWV, and will be oriented towards Warfare Commander functions.

[15] The Fleet Navigation Officer reports 23 such incidents in 2003 alone.

## Part 6 – Amphibious Warfare

Amphibious Warfare offers both Seaman Offices and PWO’s exposure to challenging joint operational experiences in the littoral. This specific sphere of navel operations encompasses aspects of all the PWO disciplines. Under current plans, the LCH Class will soon be withdrawn and replaced by a new capability. The ADF maritime heavy lift inventory is expected to include two large amphibious and/or heavy lift ships for the foreseeable future. It should be noted that the totality of the ADF’s amphibious capability will be analysed to determine its precise future composition. Therefore Navy will continue to require warfare officers experienced in amphibious operations.

Appointment to PWO positions in the LPA Class and LSH (and their replacements in due course) is suitable for an officer who is PWO qualified, preferably with amphibious and joint warfare training. Command of the LPA and LSH ships is expected to remain at Commander rank. Officers with skills mentioned above and amphibious experience and a knowledge of land force operations, would be well placed to aspire to these commands.

The C3I capability of the LPA Class provides a broad operational flexibility fir the ADF and offers exposure to varied and unique command experiences. Later appointments such as Commander Amphibious Task Group (Captain rank) would benefit from prior LPA or LSH command.
